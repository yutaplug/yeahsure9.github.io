# Aliucord plugin searching guide

Don't ask where a plugin is, find it by yourself!

on Aliucord Discord server, open the searchbar ([magnifying class icon at the topbar right corner](https://files.catbox.moe/6nuiq7.webp)), now type `in:#plugins-list in:#new-plugins in:#unmaintained-plugins PluginNameHere` (replace PluginNameHere with the plugin name, fer example if you want MessageLogger, type MessageLogger, almost every plugin is published with no spaces so you need to type it this exact way). If the `in:` parameter doesn't work and still gives results for all channels, you have your Aliucord in another language that is not english, in this case, change it to english or type `in:` but in your language. You can also add the parameter through [this page
](https://files.catbox.moe/kgio55.webp).

Alternatively, if you still can't find it you can search `PluginNameHere.zip` to (probably) find a message containing the raw link of the desired plugin, if its sent by a trusted member, you can install it by holding the message (NOT THE LINK) (trusted members are people with support-helper or plugin-developer roles). In #plugin-development channel, every plugin can be installed by holding the message no matter the user.

**Note:** Installing plugins by holding a message in #unmaintained-plugins channel is not allowed, you will need to read the [#unmaintained-plugins installation guide](https://yutaplug.github.io/Aliucord/beginner/#how-to-install-a-plugin-manually-required-for-unmaintained-plugins-channel).
## PluginRepo
There's also a [PluginRepo](https://github.com/mantikafasi/AliucordPlugins/raw/builds/PluginRepo.zip) plugin which you can use to easily find common/famous plugins through your Aliucord settings (basically a built-in plugins page like Vencord's one), but note that it's not updated nor synced with the plugin channels found on the server, and viceversa (some plugins are only in PluginRepo).

Installation: [Click this](https://github.com/mantikafasi/AliucordPlugins/raw/builds/PluginRepo.zip), it will download `PluginRepo.zip`, now move it to the `Aliucord/plugins` folder using a file manager & restart Aliucord.

Usage: Open Aliucord settings, you will find a `Open Plugin Repo` button at the bottom (between App Settings & Aliucord sections, it's a bit buggy and it sometiems moves its position itself), now just simply click it and try searching for the plugin you want.
