# Aliucord and its situation with Voice Chat
Aliucord always had issues with the Voice Chat feature since it was never a priority for the devs and Discord made a lot of changes that broke its functionality on the old Discord app that Aliucord uses, making it even harder for the devs to fix even if they wanted.

But now, it's even worse; Discord announced that [starting on March 1st, 2026](https://discord.com/blog/bringing-dave-to-all-discord-platforms) they will be forcing their [New End-to-End Encryption Protocol for Audio & Video](https://discord.com/blog/meet-dave-e2ee-for-audio-video) (which they call DAVE), meaning that users with old clients (such as Aliucord) won't be able to join/participate in Voice & Video conversations anymore (and if it's not clear yet, [this wont be a choice](https://files.catbox.moe/msn8uv.png)).

For Aliucord devs, this was the last straw. Nobody would want to write the whole protocol implementation for Aliucord, unless a random person comes willing to do it, which is very unlikely.

## Recommendation
The most we can recommend for now, is to use the [Official Discord App](https://discord.com/download) for calls, and keep using Aliucord to enjoy its chat features. Sadly, there's no estimation for the future of Voice Chat on Aliucord.

## Don't leave yet, we still have some good news
If you still want plugins to improve the Voice Chat experience on Discord (such as [Bluetooth Audio Fix](https://files.catbox.moe/cms8px.png)), we strongly recommend looking for another modified Discord client that uses the new version, in which Voice Chat has the minimum number of errors compared to Aliucord and will support the new encryption protocol. You can find a updated list of modified Discord clients and their status [here](https://github.com/Discord-Client-Encyclopedia-Management/Discord3rdparties).
